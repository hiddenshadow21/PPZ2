	 * This interface can used to get motion data from application or game.
	 *
	 * When the ForceSeatMI telemetry is implemented in application, any motion software is able to gather simulation data and
	 * control motion platform (2DOF, 3DOF or 6DOF). This structure should be filled by the application and sent to motion processing 
	 * system. It is require to fill "structSize" and "mask", other fields are OPTIONAL. It means that the application does not
	 * have to support or provide all parameters mentioned below, but it is good to provide as much as possible.
	 *
	 * DEPRECATED: For new applications use FSMI_TelemetryACE.
	 *
	 * FIELDS LEGEND:
	 * ==============
	 * All values are in local vehicle coordinates.
	 *
	 *   YAW   - rotation along vertical axis,
	 *          > 0 when vehicle front is rotating right,
	 *          < 0 when vehicle front is rotating left
	 *   PITCH - rotation along lateral axis,
	 *          > 0 when vehicle front is rotating up
	 *          > 0 when vehicle front is rotating down
	 *   ROLL  - rotation along longitudinal axis,
	 *          > 0 when vehicle highest point is rotating right,
	 *          < 0 when vehicle highest point is rotating left
	 *   SWAY  - transition along lateral axis,
	 *          > 0 when vehicle is moving right,
	 *          < 0 when vehicle is moving left
	 *   HEAVE - transition along vertical axis,
	 *          > 0 when vehicle is moving up,
	 *          < 0 when vehicle is moving down
	 *   SURGE - transition along longitudinal axis,
	 *          > 0 when vehicle is moving forward,
	 *          < 0 when vehicle is moving backward
